## 1. Project Description. :books:

This project consists of developing a personal webpage with a modern, harmonious, and fully responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile devices, 
tablets, and desktop computers.<br>

The site structure has been conceived as a flexible and customizable prototype, allowing users to easily modify the information and links to their social networks. 
Its purpose is to serve as a digital business card, ideal for professionals, freelancers, or anyone who wishes to share their profile in an elegant and accessible manner.<br>

With an intuitive interface and carefully selected aesthetics, this webpage provides an efficient platform to highlight the user's digital identity, 
facilitating connections with potential contacts, clients, or collaborators.<br>

I have decided to write both the project and this file in English to reach a broader community.<br>

## 2. Project Access. :open_file_folder:

You can access the project in two simple ways:

**Option 1:** Clone using Git

From your command line, select the directory where you want to download the project and run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ignaciomajo/personal-page`

This command will create a copy of all the necessary files to use the project.

**Option 2:** Download ZIP

If you do not want to use the command line, go to the project URL: https://github.com/ignaciomajo/personal-page

In the top right corner, you will see the `<> Code` section. Click on it, and you will see the `Download ZIP` option.

Then, navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the zip file, and you should have the following files:

After completing these steps, you can access the files using a text editor such as Visual Studio Code to modify the template and develop your personal project.
