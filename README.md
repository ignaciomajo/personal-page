## 1. Project Description. :books:

This project consists of developing a personal webpage with a modern, harmonious, and fully responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile devices, 
tablets, and desktop computers.<br>

The site structure has been conceived as a flexible and customizable prototype, allowing users to easily modify the information and links to their social networks. 
Its purpose is to serve as a digital business card, ideal for professionals, freelancers, or anyone who wishes to share their profile in an elegant and accessible manner.<br>

With an intuitive interface and carefully selected aesthetics, this webpage provides an efficient platform to highlight the user's digital identity, 
facilitating connections with potential contacts, clients, or collaborators.<br>

I have decided to write both the project and this file in English to reach a broader community.<br>
